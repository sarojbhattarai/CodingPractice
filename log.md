# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: May 26, 2020

**Today's Progress**: An Android app is build to show famous person biographies. Tired some Recycler View and learnt basics of android progmming.

**Thoughts:** Recycler View, first of all, I find it tricky. For a moment I couldn't figure it out. But it's so simple. Little bit Exciting. Some people have already done hard work. I just have to remeber the syntax ;-). Thinking of adding more functionalites!

**Today's Progress**: Added feature to navigate from Card View to detail information. Done a layout that will be able to provide user with favourite option.

**Thoughts:** Learnt the concepts of Singleton Class in Java. Lot of coding with so much errors. Had some trouble to implement the logic. Decided to complete it any how on Day 2.
