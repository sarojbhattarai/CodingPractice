### Day 0: May 26, 2020

**Today's Progress**: An Android app is build to show famous person biographies. Tired some Recycler View and learnt basics of android progmming.

**Thoughts:** Recycler View, first of all, I find it tricky. For a moment I couldn't figure it out. But it's so simple. Little bit Exciting. Some people have already done hard work. I just have to remeber the syntax ;-). Thinking of adding more functionalites!
